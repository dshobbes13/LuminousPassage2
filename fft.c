// fix_fft.c - Fixed-point in-place Fast Fourier Transform

// All data are fixed-point short integers, in which -32768
// to +32768 represent -1.0 to +1.0 respectively. Integer
// arithmetic is used for speed, instead of the more natural
// floating-point.
//
// For the forward FFT (time -> freq), fixed scaling is
// performed to prevent arithmetic overflow, and to map a 0dB
// sine/cosine wave (i.e. amplitude = 32767) to two -6dB freq
// coefficients.
